Introduction
In today’s interconnected world, international travel is common, but language barriers and lack of cultural knowledge can make it difficult for travelers. WanderWise simplifies travel experiences by providing real-time translations, cultural insights, and personalized recommendations. The platform integrates multiple features to help travelers better understand their surroundings and connect with others while traveling.

Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Python (Flask)
Libraries:
OpenCV for image processing
pytesseract for Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
deep_translator for Google Translate API integration
langdetect for language detection
speech_recognition for voice input
gtts for converting translated text to speech
API Integration: Google Vision API, Microsoft Translator API, OpenWeatherMap API
Setup Instructions
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/WanderWise.git
cd WanderWise
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Install Tesseract:

Download Tesseract OCR: Tesseract OCR
Update the path to Tesseract in app.py:
python
Copy
Edit
pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r"C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe"  # Windows example
Run the Flask app:

bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
The app will be accessible at http://localhost:5000.

Features Implementation
Image Language Translation
Users can upload an image containing text.
The image is processed using OpenCV to improve its quality.
OCR (using pytesseract) is applied to extract text from the image.
The detected text is translated into the target language using the Google Translator API.
If the translation is successful, the translated text is displayed to the user.
Real-Time Speech Conversion
Users can speak into the microphone, and the speech is captured.
The captured speech is recognized and converted to text using Speech Recognition.
The recognized text is then translated into the target language.
The translated text is converted back to speech using Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS), allowing the user to hear the translation.
Cultural Insights
The platform provides cultural insights related to the current travel destination, helping users explore historical and cultural facts.
Travelmate Finder
The platform includes a feature that helps users connect with other like-minded travelers for shared experiences during their trips.
API Integration
Google Vision API: Used for text extraction from images.
Google Translator API: Provides real-time text translation in multiple languages.
OpenWeatherMap API: Fetches weather data for the travel destination.
Speech Recognition API: Used for converting speech to text.
gTTS API: Converts the translated text back to speech.
Running the Application
Once you’ve set up the environment and installed all dependencies, you can run the application using the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
The application will start a Flask server at http://localhost:5000. You can access the various features (text scanning, voice translation, cultural insights, etc.) through the web interface.

Conclusion
WanderWise brings together language translation, cultural knowledge, and social connectivity to simplify the travel experience. The platform helps bridge communication barriers, promotes cultural understanding, and facilitates interaction among travelers. It leverages modern technologies like OCR, speech recognition, and machine learning to create a seamless experience for users.

Future updates may include offline functionality and a mobile app version to extend the platform’s reach.
